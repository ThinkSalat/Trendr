# Trendr

### A site to share and create whatever you like

Trendr is a responsive React-Redux web app using Ruby on Rails on the backend. Simply put, people use Trendr to share whatever they desire using personally curated blogs.

Trendr is closely modeled after microblogging and social networking site Tumblr.

The main attraction of the site is the main feed, in which you're treated to the latest updates from the blogs you follow. This is where the heart of the content lives.

In order to create that content, a user can use the New Post Navbar to select the type of post they'll be making. They'll be presented with an easy to use form to create their post.

It's as easy as clicking and dragging your content into the form!

Trendr is filled with colorful blogs and content. Users can use the explore page to find content they might otherwise miss out on.
