The potency of Winant&rsquo;s piece comes from the fact that it ought not to strike us at all. <i>(Detail from &ldquo;My Birth&ldquo; (2018), &copy; 2018 Carmen Winant, photo by Martin Seck)</i><br /></p><p><i><i>For a full survey of\npast Pics visit <a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblakegopnik.com%2Farchive&amp;t=OTIzOWNkNTE1OGUyNTA4MzQ2MTY3ZjhmMGRjODliMGQxMzA3MDQ3ZixjdFBLWEgzVw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AqsJm6qrh8RmSk4HrDFlRlw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwarholiana.com%2Fpost%2F132014140796%2Freposted-from-my-daily-pic-of-oct-9-2015-to&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">blakegopnik.com/archive</a>.</i></i><br /></p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"image_permalink":"http://blakegopnik.com/image/172768079886","photos":[{"caption":"","original_size":{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_1280.jpg","width":1280,"height":854},"alt_sizes":[{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_1280.jpg","width":1280,"height":854},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_640.jpg","width":640,"height":427},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_540.jpg","width":540,"height":360},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_500.jpg","width":500,"height":334},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_400.jpg","width":400,"height":267},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_250.jpg","width":250,"height":167},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_100.jpg","width":100,"height":67},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6f1007323bd80f5145c514717cc5d0e5/tumblr_p6w6j856Zs1qdr6jto1_75sq.jpg","width":75,"height":75}],"exif":{"Camera":"\u0001 CORPORATION","ISO":100,"Aperture":"f/18","Exposure":"8\"","FocalLength":"22mm"}}],"can_like":false,"can_reblog":false,"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":false,"display_avatar":true},{"type":"photo","blog_name":"blakegopnik","id":172528751909,"post_url":"http://blakegopnik.com/post/172528751909","slug":"the-weekly-pic-the-andy-warhol-we-all-know-and","date":"2018-04-02 20:00:06 GMT","timestamp":1522699206,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"XNVFY1y6","tags":["andy warhol"],"short_url":"https://tmblr.co/ZCRaAy2WhWzKb","summary":"THE WEEKLY PIC:  The Andy Warhol we all know (and sometimes\nlove) was born much later than we think.

Maybe the anti-democratic depredations of Donald Trump will\nspur a new Goya to arise among us.</p><p><i>For a full survey of\npast Pics visit <a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblakegopnik.com%2Farchive&amp;t=OTIzOWNkNTE1OGUyNTA4MzQ2MTY3ZjhmMGRjODliMGQxMzA3MDQ3ZixjdFBLWEgzVw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AqsJm6qrh8RmSk4HrDFlRlw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwarholiana.com%2Fpost%2F132014140796%2Freposted-from-my-daily-pic-of-oct-9-2015-to&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">blakegopnik.com/archive</a>.</i><br /></p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"image_permalink":"http://blakegopnik.com/image/171566414626","photos":[{"caption":"","original_size":{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_1280.jpg","width":921,"height":1334},"alt_sizes":[{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_1280.jpg","width":921,"height":1334},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_640.jpg","width":640,"height":927},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_540.jpg","width":540,"height":782},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_500.jpg","width":500,"height":724},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_400.jpg","width":400,"height":579},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_250.jpg","width":250,"height":362},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_100.jpg","width":100,"height":145},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/56bc19687c2395e172c759c2fb8e6ac1/tumblr_p53hvrVGW51qdr6jto1_75sq.jpg","width":75,"height":75}]}],"can_like":false,"can_reblog":false,"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":false,"display_avatar":true},{"type":"photo","blog_name":"blakegopnik","id":171320134777,"post_url":"http://blakegopnik.com/post/171320134777","slug":"waiting-for-a-flight-thats-running-ten-years-late","date":"2018-02-26 21:00:31 GMT","timestamp":1519678831,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"uYrXyRdR","tags":["art","video art","naeem mohaiemen"],"short_url":"https://tmblr.co/ZCRaAy2VZUSnv","summary":"WAITING FOR A FLIGHT\nTHAT’S RUNNING TEN YEARS LATE THE WEEKLY PIC: This\nis a still from Naeem Mohaiemen’s video called “Tripoli...","is_blocks_post_format":false,"recommended_source":null,"recommended_color":null,"note_count":22,"caption":"<p><b>WAITING FOR A FLIGHT\nTHAT’S RUNNING TEN YEARS LATE</b></p><p><b>THE WEEKLY PIC: </b>This\nis a still from Naeem Mohaiemen’s video called “Tripoli Cancelled,” now installed at PS1 in New\nYork.

They might inspire an even deeper devotion, transforming a hired hand (or foot, in this case) into Rudolf Valentino. <i>(Photo by Matt Flynn, &copy; Smithsonian Institution)</i></p><p><i><i><i><i>For a full survey of past Pics\nvisit <a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblakegopnik.com%2Farchive&amp;t=OTIzOWNkNTE1OGUyNTA4MzQ2MTY3ZjhmMGRjODliMGQxMzA3MDQ3ZixjdFBLWEgzVw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AqsJm6qrh8RmSk4HrDFlRlw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwarholiana.com%2Fpost%2F132014140796%2Freposted-from-my-daily-pic-of-oct-9-2015-to&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">blakegopnik.com/archive</a>.</i></i></i><br /></i></p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"image_permalink":"http://blakegopnik.com/image/169745545730","photos":[{"caption":"","original_size":{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_1280.jpg","width":1038,"height":1920},"alt_sizes":[{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_1280.jpg","width":1038,"height":1920},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_640.jpg","width":519,"height":960},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_540.jpg","width":438,"height":810},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_500.jpg","width":405,"height":750},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_400.jpg","width":324,"height":600},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_250.jpg","width":216,"height":400},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_100.jpg","width":100,"height":185},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c32eaa694888b3faa1802bf76dcea83f/tumblr_p2kbi0IUaI1qdr6jto1_75sq.jpg","width":75,"height":75}]}],"can_like":false,"can_reblog":false,"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":false,"display_avatar":true},{"type":"photo","blog_name":"blakegopnik","id":169476507821,"post_url":"http://blakegopnik.com/post/169476507821","slug":"the-weekly-pic-jason-rhoades-always-believed-that","date":"2018-01-08 20:58:34 GMT","timestamp":1515445114,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"EJPlGwzT","tags":["art","jason rhoades"],"short_url":"https://tmblr.co/ZCRaAy2TrbaYj","summary":"THE WEEKLY PIC: Jason Rhoades always believed that too much was never\nenough.
