The first frame shows how many of the first 100 primes end in 1, 3, 7 and 9. They all occur roughly the same number of times, so the four squares are almost exactly the same shade of red. The next frame shows how frequently a prime ending in 1 is followed by a prime ending in 3 - and so on. A structured pattern emerges, with the final frame showing the distribution of final digits in strings of 8 consecutive primes (for the first 2 million primes). &nbsp;[<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/maths-experts-stunned-as-they-crack-a-pattern-for-prime-numbers-a6933156.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent news]</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002CSF....13.1295K\" target=\"_blank\">visualization from</a>] [<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/ZXTWgEqS\" target=\"_blank\">code</a>]</p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"image_permalink":"http://blog.matthen.com/image/141190100916","photos":[{"caption":"","original_size":{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/ad829cc3cb9eb9559263f72a5aeb9675/tumblr_o46715A6qv1qfg7o3o1_r2_400.gif","width":360,"height":359},"alt_sizes":[{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/ad829cc3cb9eb9559263f72a5aeb9675/tumblr_o46715A6qv1qfg7o3o1_r2_400.gif","width":360,"height":359},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/ad829cc3cb9eb9559263f72a5aeb9675/tumblr_o46715A6qv1qfg7o3o1_r2_250.gif","width":250,"height":249},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/ad829cc3cb9eb9559263f72a5aeb9675/tumblr_o46715A6qv1qfg7o3o1_r2_100.gif","width":100,"height":100},{"url":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/ad829cc3cb9eb9559263f72a5aeb9675/tumblr_o46715A6qv1qfg7o3o1_r2_75sq.gif","width":75,"height":75}]}],"can_like":false,"can_reblog":false,"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":false,"display_avatar":true},{"type":"link","blog_name":"matthen","id":141069437176,"post_url":"http://blog.matthen.com/post/141069437176/changus","slug":"changus","date":"2016-03-15 03:37:20 GMT","timestamp":1458013040,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"uys1mbD9","tags":[],"short_url":"https://tmblr.co/ZzJ5xx23OPCZu","summary":"changus","is_blocks_post_format":false,"recommended_source":null,"recommended_color":null,"note_count":26,"title":"changus","url":"http://www.changus.com/domains/","link_image":"https://78.media.tumblr.com/d63fecec765f01ba3056643a70cc34bf/tumblr_o42a28vFQ81qfg7o3_r1_og_540.jpg","link_image_dimensions":{"width":540,"height":284},"link_author":null,"excerpt":"name first -
